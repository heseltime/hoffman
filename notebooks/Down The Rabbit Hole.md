Down The Rabbit Hole

<!-- image -->

2024

Alice blows the Dandelion clocks Swirling twirling ticks & tocks Seeds of time in a beautiful mind Hopes & dreams entwined

Spinning silk on an endless breeze She's letting go of all she believes Ascending towards the heavens Time is of the essence

Soaring on a ight of fancy Whirling winds of pure fantasy Spinning seeds of imagination Moments of revelation

Imagination drifts into fascination Fantasy into sensation Feelings into believing Alice is dreaming

Down The Rabbit Hole

Alice is falling down the rabbit hole She's looking for her long-lost soul Roots are growing out from the walls Grasping for the root Alice falls

The roots of where she's from The roots of where she belongs The roots of where she begins The roots of all things

Grasping for something to make her whole Empty handed she's falling down the hole She's letting things slip She's lost her grip

Falling deeper underground Spinning round & round She's falling fast All her life is ashing past

Rose gardens & grand halls Lavish banquets & masked balls Sirs, lords & dames Tea parties & parlour games

Silver spoons go spinning by Golden candlesticks ying high Champagne bottles pop their corks Dancing knives & forks

Teapots go ying past Plates of cakes spinning fast ACheshire cat with a grin Teacups & saucers in a spin

Jars of jam pass her by Aspinning apple pie Chocolate cakes with cream Alice begins to scream

Alice keeps on falling Deep inner calling Falling deeper within All her world is in a spin

Great expectations Deep-rooted frustrations Nosense of belonging Alife of endless longing

She's always pretending The lies are never ending Spinning with every lie She's someone she can't deny

Tied tight with tradition Bound up with inhibition She's tied in a knot Whois she? & Who is she not?

Candles spinning round & round Lighting the way all the way down Those ickering ames of doubt Alice is trying not to blow them out

Ticking clocks go ying past The hands of time spinning fast Shadows dancing on the walls Crying porcelain dolls

Amusic box playing melodies Diaries full of memories Abook of magic tricks Rosary beads & a cruci x

Acrystal ball goes spinning by Playing cards ying high Acuckoo clock begins to chime Alice is losing her mind

Alice is entirely bonkers, all the best people are She's letting the madness out of the jar She's falling into doubt She's pouring it all out

All those things that consume her Every whisper & every rumour All those thoughts inside her head Every word they've ever said

All those times she had to pretend Driving herself around the bend All her personalities Wild fantasies

All those memories

All those worries

All those fears

Bottled tears

Alice is wondering who she is Does she truly exist? She's someone but who? She's falling into yOu

'Who am I to be?

I am someone but not me

All that doubt

Turning myself inside out'

'Twisting & turning

Longing & yearning

Wanting to be free

Trying to be me'

'I am someone I am not

I am tied in a knot

I cannot see

Whois truly me?'

It's dark up above and so below She's never being so low Falling through the earth's core She's falling forever more

In the darkness she's losing her way All her dreams are fading away She's all alone Falling into the unknown

Alice keeps on falling Nobody can hear her calling She's in the dark She's lost her spark

In the darkness she doubts she's here She's beginning to disappear It's the end of everything She's come to nothing

Spinning round & round Falling all the way down There is nothing to believe in Alice must start dreaming

In the darkness she sees a light Wonderful ideas shining bright Burning with fascination Glowing in her imagination

She's dreaming of impossible things Ten thousand wonderful things She's creating a land of wonder Aland deep down under

Another world begins to reveal itself AWonderland deep inside herself Aplace of magic and dreams Where nothing is as it seems

Something is awakening Awonderful feeling Anewbeginning Alice is dreaming

## Wonderland

The rabbit checks his watch His mind is playing hopscotch Hopping around in his own mind He's hopping mad all of the time

His mind ashes a curious state 'Oh dear, oh dear, I will be late' Illumination & revelation Not a moment's hesitation

Asudden realisation He takes a leap of the imagination He's looking for a long-lost soul In a ash he's down the rabbit hole

Alice lands with a crash into a long dark hall It's the end of the fall The White Rabbit goes hopping by 'Your late' she hears him cry

'You're lost in a world of wonder You have fallen deep down under You have fallen far Wondering who you truly are?'

'You've been wandering around in you Wondering who's who You do it every day Wondering which is the best way?'

'It's time to nd you It's the only way through Don't delay You must be on your way'

The Rabbit hops around the hall 'Follow the truth' She hears him call O hehops with a leap & a bound The long dark hall goes round & round

Alice follows closely behind The rabbit is playing with her mind She's listening to all he has to say He's telling her the best way

Onhehops around the hall 'Know yourself' she hears him call O hehops with a leap & a bound The long dark hall goes round & round

Alice is running just as fast as she can Always nding herself back where she began She's going round the bend It never seems to end

The rabbit must be on his way 'Be yourself' She hears him say O hehops on & on In a ash he's gone

Alice suddenly stops Asmall cake in a glass box It say 'EAT ME' on the top She's eating it & she just can't stop

She's eating all the cake She's beginning to shake She's feeling strange She's beginning to change

She's full of her own self-importance 'Eat Me' She's putting on quite the performance 'Eat Me' She really thinks she's someone 'Eat Me' She's looking down on everyone 'Eat Me'

She's lled with pride She's can't keep it inside Bite after bite she's eaten it all She's grown too tall

Alice walks around the dark hall Low lights glow on every wall Ahundred doors big & small She's lost in the middle of it all

She's looking for the truth within Aplace where she can begin Somewhere she can be whole Adoorway to her soul

Aglass table stands in the hall Agolden key to open them all She can open only one door She must be sure

Behind the curtain a tiny door This is the one she's sure Through the keyhole she can see She tries her golden key

Outside a wonderful garden Hopes of entering start to darken The tiny door is too small Alice is too tall

Aglass bottle stands on the table It says 'DRINK ME' on the label Alice takes a drink She's beginning to shrink

She's drinking all she's thinking Into herself she is sinking She's drinking her whole self in She's drinking everything

All those memories 'Drink Me' All those worries 'Drink Me' All those fears 'Drink Me' All those tears 'Drink Me'

She keeps on drinking She's still shrinking She's drunk it all She's so very small

## The Garden

Alice goes through the door Awonderful garden to explore Passing through to the other side Awilderness of dreams outside

The long grass whispers in the breeze Sunlight shimmers in the trees Adark golden sky Dragon ies go racing by

Bumblebees pass with a zoom Wild owers burst into bloom Sweet exotic perfumes Strange magic mushrooms

Giant foxgloves rise up above Passion owers burn with love Morning glories brightly glow The dandelions blow

Alice walks through the long grass All her dreams have come to pass Wandering deep down under She's in a world of wonder

Golden rays dance across the sky Dark clouds go wandering by Awarmrestless breeze Ancient twisted trees

Alice is wandering deeper within Noidea where she's going She's been walking for hours Strange wild owers

Wild roses stare with curious eyes Dahlias look on with surprise Violets blink in the breeze The tiger lillies begin to tease

'Who are you?' They call 'You're very small Doyou know where you are? Have you come far? '

'I'm lost' said Alice in a cross voice 'I can't make a choice I don't know which way to go I need help if you know'

'That depends' said the wild rose 'If you're going the way we knows This is a place full of wonder You must be careful where you wander'

'I'm looking for me said Alice sadly I'm someone else you see I'm not who I used to be I'm someone but not me '

'I see' said a Tiger lily 'You're very tiny You couldn't possibly be you You're too small to be a who?'

'You have shrunk too far You are not who you truly are You must learn to grow That's the only way to go'

'Only the violets shrink Be careful what you think Be like the Foxglove Grow with love'

'Follow the light' advises the wild rose 'That's the way everyone grows Nature will show you the way Be careful not to stray '

'Let your true nature grow Grow with all you know Follow the truth in you It's the only way through'

'Nature grows all around you It grows deep within you It grows forever more Gather enough until you're sure'

'Grow towards the light You're so very bright Grow straight & true Grow into you'

The wild rose knows the way she goes Ajourney through all she knows She's reaping all she sows That's how the truth grows

'You're going on a wonderful adventure You must nd your true nature You will get there sooner or later There is nothing greater '

'It's nature's call There's Love in us all

Keep growing into you

Let the love shine through'

'You must grow with strong roots Love grows with green shoots Keep growing every hour The truth will ower '

## The Caterpillar

The caterpillar is all knowing He knows where everyone is going He sees who's who within & without He's seeking them all out

He sits on his mushroom blowing smoke rings Dreaming of impossible things Smoke spirals into the haze Alice is lost in a daze

Bubbles bubble in his hookah He takes a closer look at her She is open to suggestion He asks Alice a question

'Who are you?'

Alice doesn't know She just isn't so Wondering who's who She's fallen into yOu

The caterpillar looks Alice in the eye They don't see I to I 'You are not you You are someone but who?'

'You Alice are a mystery You are not who you imagine yourself to be You are trying to be one of every kind There are too many people in your mind'

'You are trying to be all things to all people You are unbelievable You are someone you are not You are tied in a knot'

'You are a dream in a dream You are not who you seem You are someone for sure

Who?Is the question you can't ignore'

'Sometimes I'm several di erent people

I nd myself unbelievable

I have no meaning

Nothing to believe in'

'Today I am someone new

Tomorrow I could be someone like you

Yesterday I was someone I didn't know

Nowif only I could grow into someone just so'

'I'm someone I can't ignore

I'm wrestling with every aw

I'm so unsure

I want to be more

I want to be less

I'm restless'

'I'm turning myself inside out

I'm full of self-doubt

Whoshould I be?

Whocould I be?

Whowould I be?

I'm a mystery'

Alice has been so many di erent people She's unbelievable She must learn to be wise The caterpillar gives her some good advice

'Most people are other people they know They never really grow They don't know who to be They pretend to be'

'Most people think of peculiar things In their mind the cuckoo sings Their world is very small Most people exist and that's all'

'Most people are full of other people's opinions Their minds are like pickled onions They sleep & never awaken Be yourself Alice everybody else is taken'

The caterpillar keeps on smoking He never stops talking Blowing smoke into the air Alice is becoming aware

Smoke swirls in a whirl Whirling in an endless twirl Twirling in a swirl She's in another world

'You are not one person or another You are someone other You are somewhere in-between You are just a dream'

'You are tied in a knot Being someone you are not You must learn to see You keep pretending to be'

'There is no escaping you You are there in all you do Don't pretend

Whowill you be in the end?'

The caterpillar is beginning to disappear In a moment he won't be here He's slowly drifting away Before he goes he has something to say

'Be honest with yourself everyday Get to know yourself in every way Try to be honest in all you say & do That's the way to be truly you'

'Being someone is quite something Being sure of who you are is everything Don't give up trying It's only you you're denying'

'Try a little modesty It requires self-honesty Know who's who Just be you'

## The White Rabbit

The White Rabbit is in a race against time Alice is surely losing her mind She's going round the bend Soon this dream will end

The Rabbit begins to hop All this madness must stop He tells Alice straight She's going to be late

'You are running out of time Stop changing your mind Wondering who's who? It's time to be you'

Alice is being honest with herself

Trying to nd herself

She's losing her way

Reasoning herself away

'Sometimes I think I know who to be

I imagine the perfect me

She is never me

I am not perfect you see'

'I am not perfect in any way

Mymindis in disarray

There is no perfect me

I have too many aws you see'

'I've tried to be perfect before I always nd a aw I am never happy with me WhoamItobe?'

The white rabbit continues to hop Alice never knows when to stop All her thinking leads to doubt She's turning herself inside out

'Nobody is perfect it's true You can only ever be the best of you Everyone has aws it's true Just try to be the better you'

'Always be honest with you Think about what you say & do Words mean nothing unless they are true It's what you say & do that de nes you'

'You can be too honest it's true Don't be too hard on you Sometimes the truth hurts it's true Try to be kind when thinking of you'

'Often you expect too much of you If you are honest, you know that's true It takes time to be the better you You can think too much it's true'

Alice is still being honest with herself Looking for her one true self Going deeper within Looking for somewhere to begin

'All I do is keep on reasoning There must be more to believe in Reasoning only goes so far It doesn't explain who you truly are'

'I reason with myself every day Those feelings just won't go away In deeper feelings there's doubt All that reasoning keeps running out'

'I keep trying to be reasonable I nd myself unbelievable I am somewhere in-between I am just a dream'

The Rabbit knows how she's feeling She's looking for meaning She's gone beyond all reasoning She's wants something more to believe in

'It's not what you think, it's what you know Those deeper feelings down below You must make a decision Use your intuition'

'Intuition takes you deeper within It's there that reasoning ends & you begin It's there you de ne the truth within Whoare you? & What do you believe in?'

The Rabbit knows where she's going He can see that she's growing She's going into the dark wood Alittle advice might be good

'You have been so many di erent people You have made them all believable They hide in the dark wood They are nobodies up to no good'

'You must face their every lie Look them all straight in the eye Face the lies within Find the truth again'

'There are 'others' in the dark wood They too are up to no good They gossip all day Don't listen to a word they say'

'Go & see the Toad along the way He will show you the way His wisdom is the wisest His school the nest'

## Mystery School

Toad sits on his stool Teaching his mystery school He's the head of imagination The master of transformation

His school is a magic mushroom It's a wonderful classroom Everyone is wiser as such Their muchness is much

He teaches his students the way Enlightens them everyday Opening their mind Teaching them to be loving & kind

He shows them the light The deepest insight Something to believe in Aworld of meaning

He teaches them intuition Some things are beyond de nition It's a wonderful way of knowing The love just keeps on growing

They learn to follow their feelings Feelings have many meanings Deep sensations Wonderful revelations

They follow all they know Going deeper down below Aworld of intuition Aninner vision

Intuitively they know They must go with the ow It's the only way of knowing The love keeps on owing

His students are bright Ashining light Learning to see in the dark They have found their spark

They can see the light The deepest insight The love within Illuminating everything

Shining bright It's their inner light The deepest meaning They are all believing

Glowing with illumination It's a wonderful education They are so very wise They are re ies

Alice tells the Toad how she's feeling She can't nd any meaning Lost deep within She's stopped believing

'I am never happy with my lot Always wanting more than I've got Forever wanting & needing I'm never satis ed deep within'

'I am always eating myself up Drinking from every cup Growing & shrinking I never stop thinking

'I want something to make me whole Something to ll the hole I need something more I want to be sure'

Toad can see Alice needs to lessen

She needs to learn her lesson

If she wants to be sure

Less is more

'Questioning all you know

Letting yourself go

You will never be sure

Less is more'

'Trying to be someone you are not

Tying yourself into a knot

You will never be sure

Less is more'

'Always wanting & needing for more

More than before

You will never be sure

Less is more'

'More or less?

Nothing to excess

Know yourself

Be yourself'

Alice asks toad a question He answers without hesitation Intuitively he knew She wants to know the best way through

'Deep inside you there's a spark It's right there in the dark Forever shining It's the light within'

'It's the love in you The good in all you say & do The truth within It's where you begin'

'It's a wonderful feeling The deepest meaning All you are knowing Love forever owing'

'Follow that feeling Love is revealing Put aside your inhibition Use your intuition'

'The love in you is true The path is hidden in you Love will reveal the way Stay on the path & don't stray'

'The darkness is coming You must be going Don't let it hear what you think The darkness will make you shrink'

'There is a mirror in the dark wood It re ects all that is known & understood It will show you the light & the dark You will see the spark'

'Some look & see nothing Others see everything If you want to be You must learn to see'

'Face the truth within That's where you begin Find out who's who It is the way to you'

'You must nd the light Let it shine bright Learn to see in the dark Find your spark'

## The Dark Wood

Walking through the garden The sky begins to darken Darkness begins to call It's nightfall

Shadows fall all around her The darkness has found her The night is whispering Alice is listening

The darkness is calling her name It's calling her again & again Dark shadows dance & play Trying to lead her astray

There's a dark feeling within She's following it all the way in It's doesn't feel good She nds herself in the dark wood

She's been walking for some time The darkness is playing with her mind It's listening to her think It wants to make her shrink

In the darkness she keeps on walking She can hear them talking They are up to no good She's in the middle of the dark wood

## The Dark Mirror

Adark mirror stands in the middle of the wood Re ections of all that's known & understood Truth re ects on those who look more closely Alice looks through the glass darkly

She looks closely at her own face Vanity has her in a deep embrace She is beautiful in an instance To such beauty she has no resistance

Abeauty of such perfection She loves her own re ection Abeauty of such elegance Vanity adores such innocence

Beauty has taken possession She's got the look of obsession Caught in her own gaze Such a beautiful face

Alice begins to scream It's a terrible dream Suddenly she's growing old Time has taken hold

The mirror is showing the passage of time Every wrinkle & every line Beauty is losing its power Time begins to devour

Ageing with every passing hour She's as pretty as a wilting ower Re ections of growing old Time has told

Her beauty has worn thin Real beauty is deeper within The mirror never lies True beauty is in the eyes

Alice must look deeper within Nowshe can begin Lost in her own self-deception Darkness begins to cloud her re ection

Alice looks again into the dark mirror The dark clouds begin to disappear She wants to see Whois truly me?

Alice is full of her own self importance She's putting on quite the performance She really thinks she's someone She thinks she's better than everyone

She doesn't listen to anyone

She tries to impress everyone She's a very square a air She really doesn't care

She's re ned

She's over de ned

She's cannot see

She doesn't know who to be

'This Alice is not truly me She is who I pretend to be I cannot believe what I'm seeing' Alice starts screaming

Alice has been deceiving herself Not being her true self Lost in her own self-deception Darkness begins to cloud her re ection

Alice looks again into the dark mirror The dark clouds begin to disappear She wants to see Whois truly me?

Alice has a wonderful mind

She's loving & kind

She's reasonably modest

She's tries to be honest

She's a great friend

She's loyal to the end

She always tries

She's very wise

She's happy & free

She knows who to be

She can clearly see

She is truly me

'This Alice is truly me She is who I want to be She is the best of me She is happy & free'

Alice is tied in a knot Being someone she is not Lost in her own self-deception Darkness begins to cloud her re ection

Alice looks one more time into the dark mirror

The dark clouds begin to disappear

She wants to see

Whois truly me?

Alice is rather sad

She's going mad

She gets angry & cross

She's getting lost

She's often in doubt

She turns herself inside out

She's someone she's not

She worries a lot

She often cries

She's not very wise

She cannot see

She is not me

'This Alice is not truly me

She cannot see

She is lost in the darkness

Full of sadness'

This is her shadow that always follows It's here where she wallows Lost in her own self-deception Darkness begins to cloud her re ection

Alice is beginning to see She's not who she wants to be She has lost her way Gone astray

'I am tied in a knot Being someone I am not I am not who I pretend to be I can see the sadness in me'

'I have been deceiving myself Losing myself Wondering who to be Trying to nd me'

'I know who I want to be I want to be truly me I want to be free NowIcan see'

The dark mirror suddenly shines bright Alice looks into the light She can see the truth deep within Somewhere to begin

It is the light that lets me see

It is the love in me

It is the good in me

It is the truth in me

It's the good feeling within

The deepest meaning

It sets me free

It lets me be

It makes me whole

It is my soul

It shines in the dark

It is my spark

Alice tries to grasp the light It fades out of sight Lost in her own self-deception Darkness begins to cloud her re ection

Alice has seen the spark Shining in the dark The truth within Somewhere to begin

Tied in a knot

She's someone she's not

She must undo what is done

Become one

She must face the darkness within Find her spark again Let it shine bright See the light

## Alice's Personalities

In the deep dark wood Darkness is up to no good Dark shadows fall on this eve The darkness deceives

It's a deadly shade of night Shadows dance in the moonlight Alice goes where no one goes She goes where the darkness grows

Darkness is drawing near It's a dark wood of fear Shadows of doubt fall all about All her fears are calling her out

Dark secrets are whispering Silence is listening

Doubt is near

Fear can hear

Alice can feel the fear It's always here It wants to lead her astray Make her lose her way

Dark shadows appear Fear is near The darkness within She must never give in

Afear of who's within Afear of not tting in They are calling her out Those shadows of doubt

She's scared of being me Everyone can see She must dare to be Learn to see

The fear keeps on growing She must keep on going She must nd the spark Let it shine in the dark

In the darkness hides her former selves Secrets of the past she never tells In dark shadows they dwell Lies they tell

All her other personalities All those other realities The people she's pretended to be The lies that refuse to set her free

Secrets deep inside her She thought they would never nd her They are right there behind her Those lies have found her

The darkness is closing in She can hear them whispering Questioning all she believes The darkness deceives

They are all whispering Laughing & giggling Getting louder & louder Making fun all about her

'We made you think our way Bending & twisting you in every way Wemadeyoubehave as expected All your feelings rejected'

'We tied you in a knot Made you into someone you are not Tangled you up in thinking Forever growing & shrinking'

'We have tied you tight Making you just right Bound you up with inhibition Tied you up with tradition'

'Do as we do Think only of you Don't re ect

Be perfect'

They all want Alice to stay Trying to make her go their way Keeping her in the dark They don't want her to

nd her spark

'You must play the game You must be the same Doas we do Be perfect too'

'You must lie to be the best You must lie to impress You must lie to t in You must lie to win'

'Never be truly you That just won't do Lie until the end You must pretend'

'You must be one of us You really must Try to please everyone Become someone'

'You must play by the rules Love is for fools You must do as we say Goour way'

Alice begins to shout She's letting it all out She's getting cross with them all They make her feel very small

All those lies must end She's going round the bend She has learnt her lesson She has learnt to lessen

She faces every lie Looks them all in the eye She's done with all their lies She's growing wise

She lets them all know She's letting them all go They exist only in the past All those lies will be their last

Alice is growing wise There is a sparkle in her eyes She's nding her spark Learning to see in the dark

She's seeing things in a new light She knows their thinking isn't right They tie each other into a knot Being someone they are not

She's not going to play their game She doesn't want to be the same Finding herself deep within She's getting to know herself again

She's making light of dark thoughts Untying knots Looking on the bright side Shining a light on the darkness deep inside

She can feel that good feeling within It's growing again In the darkness she's learning to see Nomore pretending to be

## The 'Others

There are 'others' in the dark wood

They too are up to no good

Gossiping about everyone

They do it for fun

Their minds are very small

They gossip & that's at all

They are rather dim

Only darkness within

They try to pull everyone into the mud It makes them feel good Squelching about in their own sadness

Lost in the darkness

Talking about Alice

They do it with malice

Never a good thing to say

They gossip all day

'Alice is a real disappointment

A yin the ointment

Her thinking isn't right

She's not very bright'

'She will never amount to much

She is useless as such

Wecan't see it in her

She is not a winner'

'She will never change We ndher very strange

Always peculiar

She's a loser'

They like to get inside her head

Nastiness in every word that's said

Hissing & spitting away

Poison in all they say

'She doesn't look right

Adreadful sight

She's not trying her best

She never ts in with the rest'

'She's way too thin

Very pale skin

Her bum is too fat

She's as mad as a bat'

'Her head is too big

Aface like a pig

Breath of a hog

The eyes of a frog'

'She's got a funny nose Awfully big toes Sticky out ears She's nearly in tears'

Alice is holding back the tears They've been saying these things for years She's heard every word they've said It's going round & round inside her head

That's how they make you think They want you to shrink Stuck in the mud It makes them feel good

They are never happy with their lot Only happy when others are not Filling people's minds with nasty thoughts Tying everyone into knots

Alice is getting cross She has had enough of been lost Nomore listening to what the 'others' say She keeps on walking her own way

Alice is getting stronger She doesn't care what they call her They are nobody's friend They are just nasty without end

She is making light of all they say They are going the wrong way Lost in the mud They will never be any good

That good feeling continues to grow Alice is beginning to know There's love deep within She's letting it ow again

The light is shining brighter within She's growing wiser again Learning to see in the dark She's nding her spark

## The Jabberwocky

The Jabberwocky is waiting for Alice

Twisted with malice

Hiding in the dark

He wants her spark

Eyes glowing red

Vicious teeth inside his ugly head

Claws sharp as a razor

A re breathing hellraiser

He's burning with desire

Araging re

The need within

Devouring everything

Anendless need

The desire for more

More than before

He drives her too madness

Alice can hear him breathing The fear deep within He's there in the emptiness He's restless

The Jabberwocky knows all her fears He's been watching her for years Everywhere she goes he follows Hiding in the shadows

'Alice's soul is mine

She's losing her mind

Wondering if she exists?

Doubting who she truly is'

'I can feel the fear She knows I am here All that emptiness inside

It's there in the darkness I hide'

'Longing & yearning

Twisting & turning

Burning with desire

She's playing with re'

'All that need That's how I feed She wants to be free? She belongs to me'

The Jabberwocky looks Alice in the eye He roars with a piercing cry

'Stay right there

You are going nowhere'

'It's me that makes you do what you do All those feelings running away with you Pushing & shoving you around Turning your world upside down'

'It's me who created all your personalities All those other realities Fooling you into believing you were perfect Making you my obedient subject'

'It was me that made you desire

Turning you into a liar

Making you want & need Filling you with greed'

'All that jealousy

Green with envy

Can't you see

It was all me me me'

'I am the dark seed Want & need Needing to feed It's all my greed'

The Jabberwocky roars with ames Blood boiling in his veins Araging thunder in his heart Adesire to tear Alice apart

The rage within

It keeps on burning

Awild despair

Aterrible nightmare

Out of the darkness he appears Alice's darkest fears Wild fury in his eyes Flames scorching the skies

He charges raging with re Ablazing desire He's going to devour her whole Swallow her soul

Alice must face her fears

Nomore tears

It's time to ght

She's shining bright

She's believing in herself again The spark shining deep within The Jabberwocky must cease to be Ahideous monstrosity

He is made of lies

She can see it in his eyes

They are burning red

His soul is dead

Asoul of darkness Feeding on sadness She must show him the light She must ght

The Jabberwocky is charging Vicious teeth snapping Roaring ames of re Burning with desire

Alice shows him the light She's shining bright Scorching his skin Burning his soul within

The Jabberwocky keeps on coming He's going to tear her apart Alice keeps on running She's going to rip out his heart

Lightning ashes across the sky Someone is going to die Darkness & light The endless ght

Alice charges straight for his heart The light is tearing him apart He screams & roars out loud Exploding into a dark cloud

There she stands His black heart in her hands One foot on his head The Jabberwocky is dead

Fires burn all around

Nobody makes a sound

Everyone has stopped talking

Alice keeps on walking

The Jabberwocky is dead He's lost his heart & his head The 'Others' stand quietly in the mud All those other personalities have gone for good

Nomore playing with

re

Nomore burning desire

Nomore wants & needs

Nomore dark seeds

The night sky is turning red Moonlight lights the way ahead Walking in the dark wood

Alice is feeling good

## Alice Is Growing Wiser

The White Rabbit appears in a Hopping towards her in a dash Quickly he comes to a stop His mind continues to hop

ash

'You are nding your spark Learning to see in the dark The truth deep within It's shining bright again'

You have come so very far Getting to know who you truly are You are nding your soul Making yourself whole'

'You're becoming more believable every day Growing wiser in every way Keeping the darkness at bay Walking your own way'

'You must keep going a little longer Let your love grow stronger You are nearly here Getting closer everyday my dear'

'It's not what you think but what you know Those deeper feelings down below All these experiences help you grow As above so below'

'Never forget who you truly are Don't let your thinking drift too far Learn to make up your mind Let it be loving & kind'

'Stay on the path & don't stray There is no other way' Just one more knot to be undone Then you are done'

## The Message

The radio is turned on & purring Something is occurring Astrange & distant sound Amessage inward bound

The Hatter's mind is full of interference He's lacking coherence His eyes are glowing bright then dim Someone is tuning him in

He's talking nonsense with great urgency Changing station to another frequency He's talking French in long wave Nowit's English in short wave

He's vibrating with sound He's inward & outward bound The message is arriving soon Suddenly he's in tune

'The truth is in us all All in one & one in all As above so below Let the love ow'

Suddenly there's interference Total incoherence With a hiss, a crackle & a pop The message has come to a stop

## The Mad Tea Party

The moon is shining bright Stars glowing in the night Amagical feeling

Everyone is dreaming

The table is laid for tea Teapots as far as the eye can see Cream cakes and marzipan Bread & butter & Jars of Jam

Chocolate éclairs & French Fancies Sweet dreams & wild fantasies Sticky buns & sherry tri e All things delightful

Everyone's eating & drinking Their eyes are twinkling The tea is magical Their thinking wonderful

Living in a world of their own Time has left them alone Their madness is plain to see Moonlight twinkles in their tea

Sitting round the table under the willow tree The hatter is brewing another pot of tea Everyone's sitting in their favourite place Moonlight shining upon their face

The Mad Hatter has a look of surprise Madness in his eyes He dips his watch in his tea once more It's teatime for sure

The dormouse is far out in drowsy bouts He's neither here nor thereabouts Speaking when he sleeps Dreaming when he speaks

The March Hare is staring at the moon Trying to catch it on his spoon It's his favourite trick He's a lunatic

Drinking tea together They've been talking forever Losing their way Letting time slip away

The best of friends Their teatime never ends Filling their cups to the brim They are waiting for time to begin

Time has stopped the clocks Nomore ticks & tocks Time has ceased to be There is only time for tea

They are all living in the now It just happened somehow Time is waiting for the world to come Nowhas forever only just begun

In the moment there is only now That's all the moment will allow The past has gone The future is yet to come

With every cup of tea they pour The moment ows on forever more That's how the dream goes The moment ows

The Hatter pours Alice a cup of tea The moment is owing free Nowis all they know They are going with the ow

'Now is so much fun Please try a sticky bun The sticky buns are stuck in the now You can eat them forever if you know how'

'I have been eating cake forever It's now or never It just appears some how That's the wonder of now'

'Those jars of jam never end Driving us all round the bend Things last forever in the now Noone knows how'

'The tea keeps on pouring Wenever stop talking Talking about this & that Endless cups of tea & a wonderful chat'

'We all love tea & chatter It's the chatter that drives us madder Talking about wonderful things That's how it begins'

'We are always wondering why? Life is passing us by Wondering what it's all about Weare trying to gure it out'

'We question all that is Wondering if we exist Wequestion all we know Wondering if everything is just so'

'Lost in all we know Weare going with the ow Wekeep on chattering away

There is madness in all we say'

'Looking for answers in every teacup Wetry to make our minds up The truth comes & goes The tea forever ows'

'Conversations ow one into another The truth keeps changing into something other Losing ourselves in all we say We ndourselves lost in the haze'

'We keep changing into one another Imagining we are someone other Losing ourselves in each other's ways We ndourselves lost in a daze'

'We see the truth in each other's eyes It never lies It's wonderful in all its ways Looking into the eternal gaze'

'We can see forever on a clear day That's the way The truth owing on & on The moment forever long'

'Wonderland is forever changing

Dreams rearranging

Thoughts coming & going

Forever owing'

'Dreams drift one into another

Weoften change into someone other

Wenever truly are

Wedrift too far'

'We try our best to persist

Wereally do insist

Weresist

Only in dreams do we exist'

'We are all very familiar

Weare no one in particular

Weare somewhere in-between

Weare living in a dream'

The Mad Hatter begins to mutter 'I want more jam on my bread & butter I wonder who I am I think therefore I jam'

'I get jammed every now & then Thinking the same thoughts again & again It's the jam that makes me who I am Too much Jam'

'I have gone too far I must put the jam back in the jar I don't know who I am I'm in a jam'

Amindfull of confusion He butters his own delusion He likes it thick & evenly spread The jam is inside his head

The Hatter makes a fresh pot of tea He's brewing his wildest fantasy Atea to make them think Awonderful drink

Alice likes fancy teas He likes fantasies

She likes her tea in a teacup He likes his tea in a hiccup

She likes her tea with cream He likes his tea with a dream

She likes tea & biscuits He likes tea & mis ts

The Hatter makes a wonderful brew Brewing it just for you Not too weak or too strong

Never leaving it too long

He adds a little cream Adark golden cloudy dream Light swirling into the darkness

Happiness sinking into sadness

Dark thoughts whirling round & round Madness twirling all the way down Deeper into the brew

Losing you

He adds a spoonful of wonder Sinking deep down under Beginning to stir The magic starts to occur

Wonder stirring deep within Stirring sadness into happiness again Your world is in a spin Love rising up again

Stirring with love Happiness rising back up above Stirring the darkness into the light

Alovely cup of tea made just right

The March Hare drinks his tea Suddenly he can see His mind is stirring Something is occurring

He's thinking of impossible things Inside his head a tiny bell rings He's having a moment of clarity A ash of sanity

'You must get done what you can't do It's possible if you believe in you Don't be discouraged by anyone That's how impossible things get done '

'The impossible is possible if you believe It's very simple to conceive Believe the unbelievable Think the unthinkable '

'Think of impossible things That's how a dream begins Reach beyond the limit See the dream & grab it '

He takes another drink of his tea He's lost his grip on reality This moment of clarity is at an end In a ash he's going back around the bend

The Mad Hatter takes a drink of his tea Wondering who he might be? He can't stop thinking He keeps on drinking

He's thinking of the wild things That's how it begins It's his own fault Too much salt

Amindlike quicksilver Eyes burning like sulphur A re blazes within He's changing

His imagination is a wilderness Alive with all things dangerous Fire breathing red dragons Hungry green lions

Wild beasts roaming within They keep on chasing him He shouts & screams Such terrible dreams

He's changing colour Black, white then red all over He's changing into someone other In a moment it's all over

The hatter checks his re ection in his tea Wondering who he might be? He changes with every cup Trying to make his mind up

'I always drink too much Losing myself as such Lost in someone else's way Mymindkeeps slipping away'

'I was the Hare last week I didn't realise until I tried to speak I was nutty as a fruit cake Adreadful mistake'

'I was the Rabbit the week before I kept hopping more & more I was hopping mad The strangest experience I've ever had'

'I was the dormouse the week before that Falling asleep in my own hat Lost in a terrible dream I woke myself up with a scream'

'You can lose yourself in a cup of tea NowIalways check to see who is me? You must be careful what you think Consider how much you drink'

The dormouse sleeps in a teacup He is beginning to wake up He is beginning to stir Everything is a blur

His eyes are dreamy

His tea is creamy

He is ready to appear

He is almost here

His eye's blink

He starts to think

Alittle shake

He's wide-awake

Sitting up in his teacup He's making his mind up He takes another drink He's beginning to think

'Wisdom begins in wonder It's found deep down under In the deepest depths of the soul Downthe rabbit hole'

'You have opened the door You have found so much more Aplace to begin The truth within'

'Truth is the golden key It opens the doors that sets us free Behind every door there's hidden treasure Use this wisdom with good measure'

'Never take the truth lightly Consider your life wisely Let the wisdom grow It's a wonderful way to know'

'Truth is only for those who seek it You must nd it & keep it Seek it high & low Find it and you will grow'

'Seek the truth within That's the rst place to begin Seek the truth without That's what life is all about'

'Wonder what's good & bad Wonder what makes you sad Wonder what makes you glad Wonder what drives you mad'

'Be wise

Open your eyes

Open your mind

Seek and you shall nd'

The Dormouse takes a sip from his teacup He's still making his mind up Considering all he's thinking Everything he's drinking

'When we are happy with our thinking Weare joyful in our drinking Forever hopeful Our cups are always half full'

'If sadness clouds our thinking It's hopeless but we keep on drinking Doubting we will ever be happy Our cups are always half empty'

'If we are wise with our thinking There's wisdom in all we are drinking Satis ed deep within Our cups are lled to the brim'

'Often we can't stop thinking Madness in all we are drinking Wecan't keep it all in Our cups are spilling over the brim'

'We all love a cup of tea

That's how we learn to see

Letting our minds wander

Losing ourselves in a world of wonder'

'We are always drinking

Drinking all we are thinking

Drinking ourselves in

Pouring ourselves out again'

'Our minds are always brewing

Thoughts stewing

Filling up our teacup

Wedrink it all up'

'Some of us sip

Some of us dip

Some of us gulp it all down

Some of us stir it round & round'

'We drink in what's best

Pouring out the rest

Always thinking

Forever drinking'

'Please have another cup Drink it all up Let the thinking begin Drink it all in'

'Be wise with your drinking Consider all you are thinking Teacup after teacup Try to make your mind up'

'Drink in the best of you All those things you love to do All those wonderful things you know All those things that make you just so'

'Pour out what's troubling you All those things you don't like to do All those things that make you sad All those things that drive you mad'

'Know what you like & like what you know Let your wisdom grow Gowith the ow Be just so'

The Mad Hatter is always drinking

He never stops thinking

Letting his mind go astray He likes to drink his tea the same way

'I like my tea hot

Fresh out of the pot

I like to sip

Then I like to dip'

'A dark chocolate biscuit

I like to risk it

Dipping it all the way down

Trying not to drown'

'I'm always dipping

Sometimes licking

I keep on sipping

Mymindslipping'

'Dipping in the deep end I go round the bend Back up the spout Pouring myself out'

'Letting it all out I scream & shout The madness begins All those wild things'

'Those wild creatures hunting me down Bats ying round & round Vicious animals trying to eat me alive Drinking tea is the only way I survive'

'Those strange beasts of desire Dragons raging with re Sabre tooth tigers eating my cake Ahissing mysterious snake'

'Mad monkeys dipping bananas in my tea Those crazy hyenas laughing at me Red squirrels cracking nuts Awise owl tuts'

The hatter begins to scream 'What does it all mean?' He pours himself another cup Trying to make his mind up

The March Hare never makes his mind up There's only madness in his cup His mind is forever wandering free He's always drinking tea

He pours himself another cup Stirring it all up His madness stirring Something is occurring

He begins to ramble His cup has no handle Shouting & screaming 'This world has no meaning'

Drinking & drinking He can't stop thinking Pouring it all out Splashing it all about

The madness within Spilling over the brim Stirring it round & round He gulps it all back down

'My cup is always spilling over the brim I keep pouring more & more in I should have less but I always have more I am never sure'

'I hop from one crazy idea to the other Leaping from one conclusion to another Jumping into every conversation Running wild with my imagination'

'Teacup after teacup I drink it all up Full of madness

I sink into sadness'

'I keep on drinking Divisive in my thinking Thinking nobody cares I am always splitting hares'

'Divided in two

I drink for a few

One too many

I am more than plenty'

The Dormouse has made his mind up Growing wiser with every cup He knows what he likes & likes what he knows That's how his wisdom ows

He likes to sip Occasionally he may dip Alittle stir & nothing more Just enough until he's sure

He lls his teacup to the brim Satis ed deep within He likes to share all he knows That's how his wisdom grows

'Some people are always wondering why? They can't stop no matter how they try Questioning all they know Until nothing is so'

'They question what it's all about Turning their world inside out Losing all meaning Nothing to believe in'

'They question who they are Going too far Forgetting who to be Wondering who is me?

The hatter looks Alice in the eye She's still wondering why? She's not made her mind up He lls up her teacup

'Life is not a problem to be solved It's a dream to be dissolved Another spoonful in your tea? Life my dear is a mystery'

'Life is for drinking & not sipping Don't take the biscuit without dipping Have another cup of tea Afresh brew will help you see'

'Life is full of hiccups The answer is always in teacups It's all in the brew You will soon see it's true'

'Don't take life too serious You will end up delirious Life is mysterious Serious will be the end of us'

Alice pours herself another cup of tea She's drinking all she can see Teacup after teacup She's trying to make her mind up

Amindfull of wonder

She begins to wander

Drifting away

Going astray

She's thinking too much Going mad as such Drinking it all in Thinking of everything

Drifting in & out She's beginning to doubt Letting go of who she is Wondering if she exists

Alice keeps on drinking She can't stop thinking Her world is in a spin Stirring deeper within

Her mind is a blur Suddenly she's unsure Doubting she is here She's beginning to disappear

She is not as she appears She is the faintest of ideas She's losing all meaning She's stopped believing

She's little more than a rumour You can see right through her She's losing her way She's fading away

The Mad Hatter begins to panic

He's rather manic

Alice doesn't know

She's beginning to let go

'You are questioning your own existence

You must stop this instance

You must exist

Weinsist'

'Existence or non-existence

You must show more persistence

You have no resistance

You'll be gone in an instance'

'Alice starts to resist

She must persist

She insists

She exists'

The Hatter is teaching Alice a lesson Teaching her how to lessen She keeps wondering too much Losing herself as such

'You have drunk too much tea Forgotten who to be Letting your mind wander You're lost in a world of wonder'

'You are spilling over the brim You must learn to stop pouring it in All the wonder is spilling out You are pouring yourself into doubt'

'You must learn to keep it in Only ll it to the brim Don't splash it all around Some of us will drown'

'Pour just enough wonder in Then keep on drinking Only wonder until full That way everything is wonderful'

Alice remembers who she is

She knows she exists

She had lost her way

Gone astray

'I am not what I think but what I know

Those deep feelings down below

I believe in me

I know who to be'

'That good feeling deep within

That's where I begin

That's how I feel

I want to be real'

'I am tied in a knot

Being someone I am not

I want to be me

I want to be free'

The Hatter takes a drink of his tea He thinks Alice is ready to see He's going to tell her everything Show her the whole truth within

'Only I can set you free Help you see You must try to understand me It's the only way you can truly be'

'It was you who tied the knot Made us both into someone we are not Nowthere's you & me That's how we came to be'

'I was at the end of my tether You took it & tied us together You tangled us up into a knot Until I was someone you were not'

'Tied in two You are me & I am you I end where you begin I am the madness within'

'I am the one that loves you madly Worries for you gladly Thinks for you sadly Feels for you badly'

'I am your conscience deep within Trying to make sense of all your thinking Considering all your thoughts Trying to untie your knots'

'I think of you everyday Worry about you in every way You are always on my mind Weare two of a kind'

'I have considered you from every angle Your mind is in a tangle Looping the loop over & through I am tangled up in you'

'We are tied in knot Being someone we are not Weare not one but two

Wemust undo you'

'Sometimes you would think of me Just for a moment let me be I tried telling you every time Alice, you are losing your mind'

'All the people you imagined yourself to be They all became me I was not one but a crowd Your conscience speaking out loud'

'All that worry & doubt

Turning yourself inside out

Listening to no one

Pretending to be someone'

'All those thoughts you didn't want to hear That was me my dear All my concerns you ignored You wouldn't believe you were awed'

'All those sad feelings within You denied them again & again Losing your spark Getting lost in the dark'

'We belong together

Always & forever

Weare one soul

The whole truth that makes you whole'

'We are the light & the dark Without one another there is no spark Together we can see everything The truth deep within'

'You are the light that keeps on shining The love within The happiness that rises above True love'

'I am your shadow forever following The madness within The sadness you have come to know The darkness deep down below'

'We must look out for one another Stop changing into someone other Wemust be as one Every knot undone'

'Your light keeps the darkness at bay Making the sadness fade away You can see in the dark You are the spark'

The Mad Hatter can see it in her eyes She's beginning to realise She's found her long lost soul Nowshe wants to be whole

'Deep down in the hole there is wonder Stay too long and your mind will wander You must be careful my dear Everyone is mad around here'

'You can wonder forever it's true Sooner or later you have to do Whatever you do you must be you Nobody else will do'

'One last knot Weare someone we are not Wemust undo what is done Become one'

The Hatter brews another pot of tea Afresh brew so Alice can see He's making a special brew Abrew that will make her true

Alice is shrinking in size It's happening before their eyes She's tied in a knot He drops her inside the teapot

He's going to let her stew Deep in his special brew Pouring in all the things she forgot He's brewing a storm in a teapot

He's mixing in a whirlwind He's stirring up a headwind He's whipping up a storm He's pouring in a thunderstorm

Thunderbolts & lightning It's all very frightening Hurricanes in a spin Dark storms brewing within

Dipping her in & squeezing her out He's mixing & stirring her all about All her dreams he's mixing in All her fears he's stirring in

Aspoonful of the light & dark Awhole spark Adash of happiness Asplash of madness

Alice is in a whirlpool in a spin Going deeper within Spinning round & round Trying not to drown

He's tinkering with her thinking Her eyes are twinkling She's drinking all he's thinking Into herself she is sinking

She's still unwinding Ties are unbinding She's coming undone He won't stop until she's done

Alice is a tempest in a teapot She's losing the plot She's going up the spout She's inside pouring herself out

All those fears

Endless tears

All that doubt

It's all pouring out…

All those memories

Endless worries

All that longing

She keeps on pouring

All that sadness Aswirling madness Every scream & shout She's poured it all out

Inside the teapot She's untying the knot She's drinking all the tea She's drinking all of me

The tea is brewing She's undoing The love is growing She's all knowing

Brewing & brewing Her mind is undoing Making up her mind She is loving & kind

She can see the light It's shining bright The knot is undone Alice is one

## Tweedledee & Tweedledum

Tweedledee & Tweedledum Together they are one They love to play

That's their way

The twins give each other a hug With a laugh and a chuckle they shrug Holding hands they dance in a ring Round & round the merry go round they sing

'Tis love that makes the merry-go-round Tis love that makes the mind sound Tis love with which our souls are bound Tis love with which we are lost & found'

The twins love one another They couldn't imagine it any way other They are the best of friends Their love never ends

## The Cheshire Cat

Acat slowly begins to appear

First a grin & then an ear

Two eyes, a nose & another ear

The Cheshire Cat is here

He has a wonderful imagination

It's a glorious emanation

Oncloser examination

He's quite the manifestation

His presence is very familiar He's everywhere & nowhere in particular All seeing & all knowing Forever owing

Alice is very curious

Life is mysterious

She wants to know beyond all doubt

'What is life all about?'

The cat smiles with a big grin

'Where do I begin?

There are so many questions my dear

The truth isn't always clear'

'Why is there something rather than nothing?

Whyis there smiling & laughing?

Whydowecry?

There are so many questions why?'

'Why do we love?

What's up above?

What's down below?

What do we really know?'

'Why are we happy & sad?

Whyis there good & bad?

Is life just a fad?

It could all drive your mad'

'Why are we here?

Is the end near?

Isn't life odd?

Is there a God?'

'What would life be without wonder? The answers lie deep down under The truth goes beyond all words my dear Eventually all will become clear'

'It's wonder that keeps you going on Without it your curiosity would be gone You wouldn't stay here for long That's why the truth goes on & on'

'I rarely interfere The choice is always yours my dear You are free to do as you please The truth is what everyone believes'

'Intuitively you will know Some things are just so Other things are meant to be Sometimes you have to wait & see'

'The truth is di cult to grasp Keep searching until the last Not all things are as they seem It's all just a wonderful dream'

Alice asks the Cheshire Cat who he is Does he really exist? Is he part of her imagination? She would like an explanation

The Cheshire Cat begins to grin 'I am the truth within I am whatever you want me to be I am your curiosity'

'I am the moment forever long I am in nity on & on I am one divided into many I am plenty'

'I am not one thing or another I am something other I am in the middle I am a riddle'

'The Cheshire Cat keeps on grinning His eyes twinkling O he ows on & on In a ash he's gone

Muchness

Smoke swirls & twirls into the air The caterpillar is out there Drifting somewhere near In a pu of smoke, he begins to appear

'You have opened your mind All in good time Your muchness is much You are truly you as such'

'Now you must learn to keep your balance Wonderlands greatest challenge Less of a much & you're not as such More of a much & you're much too much'

'You must grow the proper way Be wise in every way Think about what you say & do Alittle wisdom will help you through'

'Always be wise with your thinking Stop growing & shrinking Don't think too much You will go mad as such'

'Try to be more positive Not so negative Try a little modesty Remember to look at yourself honestly'

The caterpillar gives Alice some mushroom 'Be careful how much you consume One side will make you grow taller The other side will make you grow smaller'

'There are two sides to everyone you know You must be careful how you grow You must grow the proper way Don't get carried away'

'A mushroom to grow and shrink Amushroom to make you think Be careful how much you consume You could consume all of you too soon'

Alice takes a bite from the right side Something is happening deep inside Astrange feeling within She's growing again

She's contorting & distorting She's bending & warping She's a twisted contortion She's growing out of all proportion

Her head is beginning to swell It's not going well She's got her head in a cloud She's feeling proud

She's full of her own self-importance It's quite the performance She really thinks she's someone She's looking down on everyone

She's growing too tall She's going to fall She's much too much She's unbearable as such

Alice quickly takes a bite from the left side She's sinking deeper inside She's beginning to think She's beginning to shrink

She's starting to doubt who she is Wondering if she exists Thinking too much She's shrinking as such

She's beginning to go mad Feeling sad All the wrong thinking She keeps on shrinking

She tries a little modesty More self-honesty Hoping for the best She's shrinking less & less

She tries to be positive Not so negative She's being wise She's stopped shrinking in size

She's eaten from both sides She's shrunk to the right size Her muchness is much She is wiser as such

The caterpillar takes a pu on his hookah He takes another look at her Blowing smoke into the air Alice is aware

'You have faced the challenge Found your balance Your muchness is much You are wiser as such'

'You have learnt to grow the proper way There is wisdom in all you do & say Don't get too big for your boots Remember your roots'

'Be careful how you grow & shrink Be careful how you think Believe in all you know Be just so'

'Now you have found your own way There is no other way Keep going all the way through Always try to be truly you'

Smoke swirls up above Alice has found love The caterpillar can see Alice is free

'There is love in your eyes You have grown so very wise You have found new meaning Something to believe in'

'Go & see the Queen Try not to be mean She's high up above Show her your love'

Alice takes one last bite from the middle She begins to giggle She's feeling wonderful inside She can see far & wide

Suddenly she's ascending She's never ending She goes on forever She's forever now or never

Rising higher & higher Nobody can deny her She is free As far as the eye can see

She can feel the love Rising up above Endless emotion True devotion

She can see the light Shining bright In nity on & on In a ash she's gone

The Queen of Hearts

Cool fountains ascend towards the heavens Roses bloom in her majesty's presence Hedges in spirals twist round & round Cherry blossom falls gently to the ground

Grand avenues run in every direction Lawns cut to perfection Rows of trees stand tall & true The Queen's face is on every statue

Wild roses climb the wall Rose trees growing tall

Roses growing in rows

Everywhere the rose it grows

Ivory towers rise to the sky Heart shaped clouds go wandering by Acastle built of glass & stone The queen of hearts lives all alone

The Queens rose garden is hidden Noone must enter, it's forbidden In the middle grows the tree of good & evil All the apples have been eaten by all the people

They have eaten all the apples to the core Even the rotten ones that fell to the oor Nomore apples would ever fall They have eaten them all

Its branches are bare & barren Howcould such a thing happen? Banished from the rose garden The skies in Wonderland began to darken

In the beginning was the word They kept writing until their world was absurd Their minds had gone rotten Nobody could stop them

They reasoned with the mind until thoughtless They reasoned with the law until lawless They reasoned with happiness until sad They reasoned with sadness until mad

They reasoned with love until love died 'Love is beyond all reason' the people cried They reasoned with God until he was denied 'God is beyond all reason' the people cried

All good reason has gone bad Reason has driven them all mad Onthis day all good reason died 'Reason is treason' the Queen cried

The Queen is very unreasonable She's unbelievable She says what she's feeling Always shouting & screaming

She's Wonderlands sovereign ruler All her emotions rule her She blows hot & cold Everyone must do as they are told

Aqueen of furious passion Blind fury without compassion Aninner child grown wild Achild reviled

It's a very passionate a air Passion rules everywhere Emotions above all reason To think otherwise is treason

Alice and the queen play croquet Every player plays their own way It's a game of trouble & strife Every player plays with their life

The players run in all directions They are playing for the queens a ections It's a game of many dimensions Winning is something nobody mentions

The Queen whacks the hedgehog with her mallet The hedgehog ies like a bullet Through the arch on & on The game is on

Alice hits the hedgehog straight as an arrow It hits every ridge & furrow It's not a level playing eld To the Queen all must yield

The Queen is bursting with emotion She's creating a commotion Making scorching remarks Shouting with sparks

She has a wicked tongue of re She's fuelled with cruel desire Calling names with ames Playing dangerous games

She is malicious in every way Vicious in a delicious way Her hair blazes red O with their head

Alice is winning Trouble is beginning The Queen must never lose Winning is not an option to choose

'I win said Alice'

'I scored more than you You scored none and I scored two Therefore I win and you lose again I win the game'

'All reason is treason said the Queen I don't know what you mean Nonsense is what you said O with her head'

'I win said the Queen'

'You're mad Alice cried Reasoning must not be denied Don't let your emotions rule you They are making a fool of you'

'All reason is treason said the Queen I don't know what you mean Reasoning in not in the heart it's in the head O with her head'

'Nonsense said Alice turning red Without reasoning you're o your head You don't make any sense Your talking nonsense'

'Reasoning leads to realisation said the Queen That will be the end of the dream All reasoning is dead O with her head'

'Your head is in a cloud said Alice out loud Alittle love would make you less proud I must be cruel to be kind You are out of your mind'

'Love is beyond all reason said the Queen I don't know what you mean Love is dead O with her head'

Alice knows the Queen is sad It was reasoning that drove her mad Love is beyond all reasoning She stopped believing

'Love needs no reasoning It is the deepest feeling Don't be so naive You just need to believe'

'Love gives you meaning Something to believe in Loving one another Believing in someone other'

'Love sees the truth within For better or worse it keeps on loving Love is what it is It truly exists'

'I will give it some thought said the Queen I have a feeling I know what you mean In the meantime, all love is dead! O with her head'

Alice is growing tired of living in a dream She's getting cross with the Queen The Queen is very unreasonable Wonderland is unbelievable

'I want to be believable Anything else is inconceivable You are unbelievable You can't be reasonable'

The Queen thinks Alice is absurd That's the strangest thing she's ever heard The Queen wants to be unbelievable Anything else would be too reasonable

'All reason is treason You must be careful not to reason Reasoning results in realisation That's a crime in a land of imagination'

The Cheshire Cat begins to appear Any moment he will be here First his eyes & then his nose Next is tail & then his toes

He's owing into being Appearing as a dream Coming & going Forever owing

He's smiling with a grin Twirling in a spin He's quite the vision Awonderful apparition

The Cheshire cat can clearly see Alice wants to be She believes in who she is She really wants to truly exist

'If you want to be believable Then be more reasonable Stop going round the bend Reasoning will bring this dream to an end'

'We all need a little reasoning to get along Weall need a little reasoning to carry on Weall need a little reasoning to agree Weall need a little reasoning to be'

'Remember Alice never reason too far Only love knows who you truly are Love makes you be a better person It's the only way to be certain'

'You have found the love within That's where you begin You have made up your mind You are loving & kind'

The Cheshire Cat knows it's time for Alice to go She has learnt all she needs to know It's time to be reasonable She wants to be believable

'You have come a long way Listened to all we had to say You have found the way There's no need for you to stay'

'We will miss you when you're gone Don't stay away for too long Think of us every now & then Wewill see you again'

'Everyone here is your friend Wewill be waiting for you until the end Wewill always be here in the in-between All you have to do is dream'

Alice is beginning to realise Reality is starting to materialise She's being more reasonable Becoming believable

It's time to be leaving She's found something to believe in She's stopped letting things slip She's getting a grip

The clocks have started to tick Things are happening quick All is becoming clear The end is near

The light is beginning to change Everything looks so strange Shadows dance & play Wonderland is fading away

The White Rabbit whispers in her ear The end is here Wehave taught you all we know It's time to go

'You are no longer someone other You are yourself & no other You know who you truly are You have come so very far'

'The love in you is true There is no other you Love the things you do Remember to love you'

'Love is revealing Follow your feelings Love will show you the way Stay on the path and don't stray'

'This dream has come to an end You've gone all the way round the bend Your mind is open You have awoken'

Mother Nature

The eyes of the day are open She has awoken Sun shines in her imagination The light of illumination

Aliving presence She's nature's essence Her true beauty precedes The dreamer believes

Hidden & concealed She will be revealed Just one glance She is the eternal dance

The spirit in us all She's nature's call Alight within The truth in everything

Dreaming the dream She's nature's Queen Abeautiful revelation Awonderful creation
