It appears that you have provided a PostScript code for an illustration with a caption. Here's how to interpret it:

1. The image file used is from iStockphoto.com and was created by Jamie Lee.
2. The text "Illustration" is the title of the illustration.
3. The following lines define the position, size, and rotation (if any) of the text in the output PDF or PostScript document.
4. In this case, the text "(iStockphoto.com)" and "(Jamie Lee)" are placed on separate lines (newlines indicated by `Tj` command) and aligned to the left with a 12pt indent (`.153 Tw` command). The actual text is centered along the y-axis of its bounding box, as specified by the `Tm` command.
5. The final line `ET` ends the text block in PostScript.
6. After the text, there are commands related to color and font settings:
   - BT sets the graphics state for drawing (e.g., color mode, font). In this case, a grayscale color mode is set with 0.48 for the black component and 0.766 for the white component using the `scn` command, and Font3 is selected using the `/F3 1 Tf` command.
7. The last line `Q` ends the graphics state change, indicating that subsequent PostScript commands will be drawn with the default settings (in this case, with the grayscale color mode and font F3).
